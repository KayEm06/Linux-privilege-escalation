# Privilege Escalation

Privilege Escalation is the elevation of permissions to gain leveraged access to resources on a computer system or network. Typically, credentials are provided to access privileged users; however, attackers with compromised access can exploit bugs, design flaws, and configuration oversights in system infrastructure to obtain and masquerade as higher privileged accounts.

Vertical privilege escalation, or privilege elevation, enables attackers to elevate permissions to access higher privileged users. For instance, exploiting vulnerabilities to move from an ordinary employee account to a network administrator.

Horizontal privilege escalation, or account takeover, allows attackers to laterally move across to similarly privileged accounts. For instance, moving from the accounts of one network administrator to another.
